    "## REACT Agent Chat Message History Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://getzep.github.io/) as memory for your chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.\n",
    "2. Running an agent and having message automatically added to the store.\n",
    "3. Viewing the enriched messages.\n",
    "4. Vector search over the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on Zep:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zep stores, summarizes, embeds, indexes, and enriches conversational AI chat histories, and exposes them via simple, low-latency APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long-term memory persistence, with access to historical messages irrespective of your summarization strategy.\n",
    "- Auto-summarization of memory messages based on a configurable message window. A series of summaries are stored, providing flexibility for future summarization strategies.\n",
    "- Vector search over memories, with messages automatically embedded on creation.\n",
    "- Auto-token counting of memories and summaries, allowing finer-grained control over prompt assembly.\n",
    "- Python and JavaScript SDKs.\n",

Let's start by brainstorming some features and functions that you would like this agent to have.

To generate effective prompts for your LLM-powered agent, we can start by brainstorming some common scenarios or topics that your partner may want to explore.

The human then asks the AI to write a poem about the power of emojis, and they discuss creating an agent to help the human's partner explore her desires. They brainstorm prompts related to sexuality and gender identity, and the AI suggests refining them based on feedback. The human asks for a sample prompt for their partner and for a system prompt for the agent, and the AI provides examples for both. The AI also emphasizes the importance of feedback and asks if there's anything else they can help with. The conversation ends with the human thanking the AI for their assistance.\n",

They can convey tone, mood, and context that may not be easily expressed through words alone.
